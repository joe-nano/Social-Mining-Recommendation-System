Towards Linked Extraction Tweets Manel Achichi Zohra Bellahsene Ienco Konstantin Todorov Université Montpellier LIRMM firstname lastname lirmm IRSTEA Montpellier TETIS ienco teledetection Abstract Millions Twitter users messages every communicate other users information about events occur their ronment studies content tweets focused detec emerging topics However knowledge approach proposed create knowledge enrich automatically infor mation coming tweets solution propose composed phases topic identification tweets classification automatic summariza creation triplestore proposed approach implemented system covering entire sequence processing steps collection tweets written English language based trusted crowd sources creation dataset anchored DBpedia namespace Introduction goals Linked initiative structure interconnect using semantic technologies Resource Description Frame taking today level where interpretable accessible humans machines Bizer considerable effort direction throughout couple years However sources valuable information still remain unexplored although contain useful beneficial project paper focus social medium Twitter provides platform publication short messages tweets maximal length characters network enjoyed growing popularity through years becoming major source novel information about important events available often before diffusion through conventional broadcasting channels tivation enable integration information flowing daily through Twitter stream propose method extraction relevant Tweets their conversion their storing triplestore final objective their publication linked approach covers entire processing chain following defined workflow which presented Section Towards Linked Extraction Tweets Related family related approaches focuses relation extraction divided those based dependency those based syntactic parsing systems Reverb Fader multilingual DepOE Gamallo latter group CLAUSIE Corro Gemulla former system OLLIE Schmitz based relation patterns which extracted Reverb There categories approaches extract triples first category exploits background knowledge infer facts example method proposed Anantharangachar where triples extracted using domain specific dictionaries induced existing ontology methods belonging second category usually apply semantic analysis Exner Nugues Augenstein Cattoni Cattoni large scale

context information managed resource distinguish between approaches tweets summarization first group vides terms summary Cataldi Benhardus Kalita ioudakis Koudas while second extracts representative tweets Approaches second group suitable preserve structural coherence conciseness derived summary Sharifi tweets summarized sentence derived graph representation words occuring collection tweets retrieve relevant tweets summary tweets lection based topic models other techniques proposed Olariu first first merges tweets graph similarly computes score function select graph possible summary second selects frequent words subsequence phrase Overview Approach processing chain covers entire process constitution Twitter corpus generation triplestore Figure Constituting corpus tweets Tweets written English first collected trusted sources Twitter accounts established media These tweets grouped together topic using topic identification techniques forming homogeneous clusters chosen MEANS clustering algorithm simplicity efficiency lowest value maintains ratio average intra cluster distance average inter cluster distance under given threshold Further every topic collect crowded tweets ordinary users accounts which enrich information contained every topic Finally tweets closely related topics represent tweets containing previously extracted keywords frequent words cluster Filtering preprocessing filtering component applied trusted crowd sources tweets contain named entities particularly DBpedia preparation linking extracted triples Achichi workflow system crowded tweets additionally filtered respect their adequacy given topic keywords describing topic Moreover tweets preprocessed removing hashtags retweets lemmatizing Crowded tweets classification introduced classification module based principle sentiment analysis order classify crowded tweets categories including neutral objective information enrich trusted tweets other including opinion private messages coreNLP assume tweet conveys factual information piece stripped positive negative sentiment However assessing polarity tweet sufficient order judge objectivity additional classification criteria check absence following features within tweet symbol indicating private message repetitive letters abuse ponctuation smileys reflect mindstate misspelled words Automatic summarization After constituing tweets corpus topic proceed generate summary corpus order remove redundant unnecessary information algorithm developed generates automatically summary topic concise coherent tweets takes parameters input tweets corresponding topic threshold control tweets similarity First algorithm constructs weighted undirected graph where vertices tweets exists between vertices cosine similarity between corresponding tweets Towards Linked Extraction Tweets greater Further algorithm proceeds extract maximal cliques relying known Kerbosch algorithm assumption maximal clique represents cluster potentially redundant information represented single tweet PageRank algorithm assign scores vertices within clique select highest score summary clique several tweets score algorithm selects longest summary entire topic given tweets representing maximal clique within topic graph tweets Finally consists transforming every summary graph inspired state approach extraction LODifier Augenstein since relies anchoring extracted semantic information DBpedia namespace approach consists steps Semantic analysis semantics every phrase modeled triple subject object algorithm given adopted adapted because effectiveness combined Stanford Parser algorithm works simple single clause sentences fails handle properly multi clause sentences propose following clause splitting iterative algorithm Apply dependency analysis complex phrase dependency relationship nsubj nominal subject retrieve relationships arguments except nsubj relationships Repeat retrieved relationship until relationship added dependencies enveloped relationship nsubj extract organize words ascending order numbers associated These numbers indicate order words original sentence Disambiguation Before assigning DBpedia choose appropriate sense given context applied commonly method based synset identification WordNet DBpedia assignment assign every corresponding DBpedia Generation graph During semantic analysis sentences composed simple clauses clause structured triple subject object system performs conversion these triples graph Arguments created during semantic analysis analyzed identify named tities correspond subjects objects assign corresponding DBpedia match subject object extracted triples existing triples DBpedia graph Prototyping Experiments Twitter Twitter4J collect tweets stream TextRazor service
